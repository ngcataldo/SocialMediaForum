<!-- To do:

At the very least, there should be a text area, and a input where the user is able to enter the url of image from online

When the user submits their data (button), it should go into a feed that exist on the page (Feed Container)

The username, time the user submitted the post, and the content should appear on the page ()

If the post has an image, it should appear also

Remember, a post can have text, image, or both

The user should have the ability to delete a post 

Figure out how to prevent users from entering bad data (ie, no text or not an image) (Alert)

Add CSS attributes



Bonus: Give the user the ability to select the text color
BONUS: Give the ability for the user to update the post in the feed. -->
